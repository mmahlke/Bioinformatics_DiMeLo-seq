###First, we need to get a copy of the dimelo package.

cd /ix1/yarbely/<your_user>
git clone https://github.com/streetslab/dimelo.git

# You should see a folder appear in /ix1/yarbely/<your_user> called 'dimelo'. 
## That contains everything needed to install the dimelo package, including instructions on all the dependencies (other tools/packages) needed to run dimelo. 
## These instructions are saved in a .yml file. 

## I know that this .yml file has a weird issue with one particular package called sorted-nearest==0.0.33 
### to avoid that issue, we will go in and edit the .yml file. So let's open the file. 
### edit the file to change `sorted-nearest==0.0.33` to `sorted-nearest==0.0.39`
### What we are doing is telling the installer that instead of installing release 0.0.33 of sorted-nearest, install the newer release, version 0.0.39
### We can also change the name of the environment at the top of the file to `dimelo_vis`. 

## We will also change the setup.py file to modify sorted-nearest==0.0.33 to sorted-nearest==0.0.39

# Next, we need to load python. The dimelo package is compatible with python/3.7.0.

module load python/3.7.0

# Now we use python to make our virtual environment.

# Change to the directory where we downloaded the dimelo package and instructions

cd /ix1/yarbely/<your_user>/dimelo

# Create a virtual environment using the edited instructions file (.yml)

conda env create -f environment_linux.yml -p /ix1/yarbely/<your_user>/envs/dimelo_vis

# Where:
### conda env create is the command to create the virtual environment itself
### -f environment_linux.yml is a the file that specifies everything that needs to be set up for the virtual environment
### -p /ix1/yarbely/<your_user>/envs/dimelo_vis is the location to create the virtual environment

# By default, packages are installed in /ihome but that has limited space, so we can specify a path where last directory is the name of the virtual environment 

# This might take some time. 

# Now activate your virtual environment.

source activate /ix1/yarbely/<your user name>/envs/dimelo_vis

# You can tell you are operating within your virtual environment because there is a prefix before your command prompt that looks like:

##  (dimelo_vis)[user@htc-n2-013]$

# Now we can install the dimelo package into our virtual environment. Installation instructions for this package are here (https://streetslab.github.io/dimelo/html/content/installation.html)
## You will notice that the steps are not identical to what I've shown here, I've adapted the steps to work for this environment 

# You may also notice that this package is depricated. That means no one is working to maintain it anymore. There is a new package being developed but as of now, it is not publicly available. 
## I encourage you to contact the package makers to get a copy of the newer package to test for your data. 

# To install the package:

# make sure we are in the directory with the package in it

cd /ix1/yarbely/<your_user>/dimelo

#install the package from our current directory to our virtual environment

pip install .

### And now the dimelo package is installed in our virtual environment called dimelo_vis
